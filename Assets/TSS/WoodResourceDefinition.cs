            Grimroot Timber – twisted wood from trees that grow in soil soaked with ancient blood.
            Wraithwood – pale, spectral lumber that glows faintly in moonlight and hums when cut.
            Blackthorn Bark – dense, jagged wood that resists blades and bleeds a dark sap.
            Ashen Yew – ghostly white timber found only in cursed graveyards and foggy swamps.
            Elderbane Oak – a towering, corrupted oak whose heartwood pulses with faint red light.
