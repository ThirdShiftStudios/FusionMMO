            Graveiron – a cold, gray-black metal said to be forged from the bones of the fallen; hums faintly when near undead.
            Bloodsilver – crimson-veined ore that gleams like wet flesh; smiths claim it “breathes” when heated.
            Nightsteel – deep obsidian metal that drinks in light; weapons made from it leave shadowy trails.
            Soulstone Ore – crystalline mineral that traps echoes of the dead; used in cursed enchantments.
            Dreadcopper – corroded red-green metal mined from haunted caverns, known to whisper to miners in the dark.
