Notes:

    - HDRP uses separate shaders, materials, and some Timelines. Prefabs are variants of the original URP version of Spells Pack 2.

    - Do not remove the original URP version, as many of its assets are dependencies for the HDRP version.

    - Do not use HDRP assets if both URP and HDRP packages are installed in the same project, as this may cause unwanted visual artifacts.

    - Some issues may occur in HDRP with VFX Graphs that use custom shaders they might not be visible.
    If that happens, open the VFX Graph, select the Output Context (render node), and disable Alpha Clipping in the Inspector Window.
    This option can sometimes be enabled automatically during the import process.

    - Sometimes, when importing the HDRP package of Spells Pack 2, all decals created with VFX Graphs may have their Exposure Weight changed to 1 instead of the default 0.1, 
    which can make most decals invisible.
